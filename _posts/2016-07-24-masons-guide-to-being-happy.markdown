A few years ago my friend Mark and I were eating lunch outside at a picnic
table on a sunny day in San Francisco. We were talking about work, stress,
life, wellbeing and happiness. Mark said that once we have all of our basic
needs covered (food, water, safety etc) there are 3 things people need to be
happy: something to do, someone to love and something to look forward to. An
important thing to notice here is that none of these three things involve
having. They’re all about wanting. “Something to do” is about wanting to
accomplish whatever it is you’re doing and “something to look forward to” is
about wanting something to happen. “Someone to love” is less straightforward
but love and want are actually fairly similar feelings. Both words even
translate to the same word in Spanish: Querer. How come we need to want
something to be happy? Louis CK calls it your <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/5HbYScltf1c?t=1m10s">forever empty</a>, the Buddhists call it
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukkha">dukkha</a>, I like to call it your Want
Monster. Your Want Monster is a little guy inside you that’s always hungry for
more. The trick is not to silence or ignore your Want Monster but to feed him
a healthy diet and learn to live happily along side him.

If you think about it in terms of evolutionary biology it makes sense we are
always wanting. Imagine you had two cavemen. They both go out and pick a
banana and come back to their caves. Caveman Bob is happy with his banana.
Caveman Joe feels a like he wants just a little bit more. The caveman who
wanted more “stuff” would end up stronger and more fit for survival. After
many generations this feeling of emptiness prevailed throughout or species. An
appetite for social gratification would be favorable as well. Imagine caveman
Joe tells caveman Bob “Hey dude don’t go west of the banana tree there’s lions
over there,” or, “I hear cavelady Susan thinks you’re cute.” Both would help
humans survive and reproduce more. The more hunger they had for social
interaction the more fit they’d be to survive.

People also like recognizing patterns. I suspect that’s the result of
evolution as well. If caveman Bob noticed a lion came out after it rained he
might recognize that pattern and stay inside after it rains. If a caveman
noticed his buddy got sick from eating red berries he’s probably not going to
eat the red berries. I suspect our love of art and music is rooted in our love
of patterns as well.  If you believe in evolutionary biology then it follows
that almost everything we desire is a result of how we evolved. Some of these
things no longer contribute to our success as a individuals or as a species. A
Want Monster has evolved inside each of us, but there’s not much of a need for
him anymore. So, how do we keep him satisfied?

There are all sorts of things you can do to feed you Want Monster. You can
work, exercise, make art, make and eat food, socialize, get laid, etc. Feeding
your Want Monster sounds fun! What I think makes a lot of people unhappy is
realizing that after you feed your Want Monster he’s still going to get hungry
again. We’re taught that sadness and emptiness are dirty feelings that need to
be avoided. This isn't true. Sadness and emptiness are necessary to feel joy.

Just like with people food, Want Monster food isn’t all healthy. Portion size
is also important. I like to think of different types of happiness like
different food groups. The happiness and instant gratification we get from
social media is sort of like the sugars and fats of happiness. Looking at
Facebook is like force feeding your Want Monster five Cheesy Gordita Crunches
from Taco Bell. He won’t be hungry after but he sure as hell isn’t going to
feel very good either. We’ve never had so much access to so much social and
mental stimulus and we’re becoming desensitized to it. Social media is ruining
social gratification just like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/internet-porn-ruined-my-life">internet porn is ruining
sex</a>. Overfeeding
your Want Monster sugary fatty happiness is not going to make him go away.
It’s going to make him sick. Technology has given us much easier access to
pleasure and counterintuitively that’s making us less happy.

It’s not healthy to starve your Want Monster either. If you do, you’ll get
depressed. Sometimes this is out of your control, however, making things
better isn’t. Antidepressants are commonly prescribed to correct chemical
imbalances in the brain. People can also exercise, socialize, eat healthy food
and/or do other activities which will get your Want Monster feeling healthy
again.

Happiness is much more of a cycle than it is a state (See the figure above).
Pleasure is just one phase of the cycle. Listening to music is a good example
of this. Most of the time while listening you’re waiting for the chorus. When
it finally comes you getting a feeling of relief and pleasure. Does that mean
if you just listen to the chorus over and over again you’d get the same
feeling? Probably not. Brené Brown gave a great TED Talk about <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability?language=en" target="_blank">the power  of vulnerability</a>.
If you’re at all interested in the study of happiness I’d definitely give it a
watch! In it she says we are “the most medicated, in debt, addicted and obese
nation in the world.” She explains that we can’t numb sadness and pain without
numbing happiness as well. Feeling sad is a natural part of being human. Or,
as one of my running coaches put it: embrace the suck.

Thoughtout human history we have told each other tales of true happiness. One
of my favorites is The Princess Bride. Like in most fairy tales Westley and
Buttercup live happily ever after. It’s a nice way to end the story but what
the hell does that even mean? Does he have a job? What’s their sex life like?
The truth is, happiness isn’t about rescuing Princess Buttercup or Avenging
your father's death. It’s about battling rodents of unusual size in the fire
swamp. It’s about storming the castle. It’s about the adventure along the way. 

With your balanced happiness diet of exercise, acceptance, pain and suffering
hopefully you and your Want Monster can get along a live a long and happy life
together.
