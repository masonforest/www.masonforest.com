The second anual [Dublin Blockchain Hackathon](https://blockchain-hackathon.com/) was a huge success again this
year! 12 teams and over 150 people competed for a €5k first prize. Our team,
team Orion, came in second!

Orion is a global augmented reality cryptocurrency treasure hunt (_think:
Pokémon GO but instead of searching for charzards you're searching for
bitcoins_). We built Orion on the [Ethereum](http://www.ethereum.org/)
blockchain so we could have multistep treasure hunts where players travel
around a city finding prizes along the way. Ethereum allowed us to program
treasure hunt rules into smart contracts directly on the blockchain.

For our MVP we built a murder mystery scavenger hunt. The clues lead players
around Dublin searching for a lost painting. For our MVP we paid out Ether.
In later iterations payouts could be smart assets such as tokens for beer or
coffee at local pubs and coffeeshops.

We had a well balanced team of developers, designers and business people from
from Ireland, France, Poland, The Netherlands, and the USA.


The Orion team was proud to take second place winning us €2k!
