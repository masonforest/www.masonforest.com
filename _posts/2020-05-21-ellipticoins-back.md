Ellipticoin is back!

Four months ago I stopped working on Ellipticoin to join the
[Optimism](https://optimism.io/) team full time. Last Friday was my last day at
Optimism and I'm now working on Ellipticoin full time time again!

I loved my time at Optimism and what they are building is going to be at the
center of our new decentralized world but I realized that going back to
Ellipticoin was too good of an opportunity to pass up.

First off, my time at Optimism validated what was proved to me when I
was at Compound: Ethereum's developer tools leave a lot to be desired.
Development with Truffle and Solidity feel like I'm programming with my arms
tied behind my back! Development in Rust is much more productive and fun. Rust
is now in use at
[Apple](https://jobs.apple.com/en-us/details/200144575/software-engineer-networking-privacy-edmonton-canada),
[Microsoft](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2020/04/30/rust-winrt-public-preview/)
and [many more](https://www.rust-lang.org/production) of the worlds leading
companies.  Being able to leverage all the work that's gone into the Rust
language and community will be a boon to the blockchains that adopt it as their
main programming language. It's been a blast going back to writing smart
contracts in Rust and I want to share that experience with the broader
blockchain community!

Secondly, it's looking more and more like there will be many blockchains in the
future instead of a single winner. Interchain protocols like
[Keep](https://keep.network/) and [Ren](https://renproject.io/) are coming
online and "Eth2 Killers" have raised [hundreds of millions of dollars](https://messari.io/article/fire-before-growth-the-likely-fate-of-ethereum-killers-by-chris-burniske). Also
with all the buzz around DeFi, the Bitcoin Halving  it's looking like things
could be heating up again!

Finally new methods of fundraising have emerged: one of which being the Initial
Dex Offering. This is really what made the decision too good to pass up. People
are interested in Ellitpcoin but there isn't a liquid market of buyers and
sellers yet. I could have built a simple decentralized exchange using cross
chain atomic swaps but that would be non-trivial. The other option was to go
pitch wealthy investors and sell them tokens at a discounted price. That would
give them an lopsided power over other users of the network which I would like
to avoid if possible. This would also give me my payout upfront as opposed
to later on. If I get my payout ahead of time I'm much less incentivized to
launch.

I'm much more interested in seeing this launch than I am in making lots of
money. Sure money would be cool for a few days but then eventually I'd go back
to watching Tiger King and being locked inside just like everyone else.

I've also got some other news to report: I've got a cofounder!

[Tom
Schachte](https://twitter.com/tomschachte?lang=en) is currently a Digital
Marketing Consultant also based in Charleston, SC. I met Tom a couple years ago
and we've been having lunch every other week or so ever since. Tom's also a fan
of [Sapiens](https://www.ynharari.com/book/sapiens/), health and wellness and
building software that users love to use. I think his degree in philosophy, his
experience in business and his passion for product will all serve Ellipticoin
well. I also think Tom and I's skill sets and viewpoints compliment each other
well. While Tom is probably both a stable and a volatile but he definitely
[stabilizes my volatility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztmUUkuVWjk). I'm
excited to have him onboard!

Our plan is to launch a prototype version of the network with real money flowing through it some time in June!

In the initial phase we plan to have a community run burn bridge which runs between Ellipticoin and an ERC 20 token on Ethereum. We plan to set up a market on Uniswap, provide some initial liquidity and see where things go!

More on this soon!

In the mean time feel free to check out the [Ellipticoin Wallet](https://wallet.ellipticoin.org/) and head over to the [Ellipticoin Telegram room](https://t.me/ellipticoin) and say hello!
